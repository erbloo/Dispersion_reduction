# Dispersion_reduction
This repo is the code for the paper “Enhancing Cross-task Transferability of Adversarial Examples with Dispersion Reduction” published on CVPR Adversarial Machine Learning in Real-World Computer Vision Systems(CVPR’19).https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03333

### Docker Quick Start
Build the docker image and all dependencies will be installed automatically.
```
docker pull erbloo/baidu_aisec:yantao_v1.0.0
```

generate_DR_images.py generates adversarial examples as images using DR attack.

Detailed demo is shown in https://github.com/anonymousjack/dr
